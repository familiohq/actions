For an example of how to create an action check the [`./example`-directory](https://github.com/paralenz/actions/tree/master/example)

## Notes

### How to use composite actions in composite actions
If you wish to use one of these composits actions in another composite action you will need to use the full name (eg `paralenz/actions/setup-node@master`)
#### Example:
The the `publish-release`-action depends on `setup-node`. In this case you would need to do `- uses: paralenz/actions/setup-node@master`.

If you use `./setup-node` in a workflow in another repository (lets call it MY_REPOSITORY), the workflow in MY_REPOSITORY will look for for `./setup-node/action.yml`-file in the MY_REPOSITORY.

## Creating new actions
So you might wonder. But, how do I create a new action?

Dont worry. I got you! You can either use the fast way or the cumbersome.

#### The Fast way
```sh
yarn action:new:composite
```

#### The Cumbersome way
1. Create a new folder with the name of your action.
1. Create an action.yml file.
1. Enter all the data you need

## Publishing a new version
It is fairly easy to publish a new version.

The workflow is setup so when ever a pull request is merged into the `master` -branch it will automaticlly create a new release. For this we will use the `version` in `package.json` to set the correct tag and release name.

### So what happens in the `release`-workflow?
1. First we will lint the code using `@paralenz/eslint-config-typescript-react`.
1. Documentation will be generated based on all `**/action.yml` files in this project. The newly generated documentation will be committed.
1. We will use the `version` from `package.json` to create a new tag and a new release with the specific version. The tag and release will be prefixed with `v` (v1.0.0) - You do not have to lock your workflow to a specific version of the paralenz/actions, you can use the `@master` to use whatever is located in the master branch.
1. ðŸ’° Profit!
